# Ferret Detector
A Single-class Yolo11x model for ferrets with two utility scripts.

## Utility

### YoloWebcam
---
Pyqt6 tool to load model and add cameras with confidence threshold.

### Ferret-Detector Notebook
---
Jupyter notebook to streamline model training and access to Colab gpu/tpus.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/BioSh0cked/Ferret-Detector.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
1. Run the webcam file or plug model into desired interface.

2. After loading model, select confidence threshold.

3. Add desired camera (Optionally record output).


### Previous Progress
---
Originially had a yolov3 model with labeled dataset images with no paramater optimizations.

### AI Usage
---
- Moderate in-line code completions were used in the creation of utlity scripts.

- Hours were already reduced to account for this, the scripts are simply to make the model demoable and the notebook was included as it was involved in the creation of the model.

- This project is simply to highlight the model and as such was done with manual journaling as most task cannot be performed in the IDE. Tab completions were used with full and clear understanding as planned code.
